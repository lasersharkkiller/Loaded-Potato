Here are the key points of analysis:\n\n1. Obfuscation Techniques: The code uses obfuscated strings and variable names, which is a common tactic to hide the true purpose of the code from casual inspection. For example, the use of concatenated strings like `VBA.Environ(\"Progr\" \u0026 \"amW6\" \u0026 \"432\")` makes it less readable.\n\n2. Registry Manipulation: The macro contains functions that construct commands for adding registry entries using `reg.exe`. Specifically, the `UnBlock` and `lock_document` functions build commands to add keys under `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID`, which can be used to establish persistence or execute code on startup.\n\n3. File Operations: The macros include functionality to read and write files, particularly through the use of `DeleteImage`, `WriteImage`, and `ReadImage` functions. This indicates an intention to manipulate files on the system, potentially to drop malicious payloads.\n\n4. Execution of External Programs: The command constructed in the `unlock_document` function suggests that the macro attempts to execute external programs (e.g., `vr32.exe`). This could be indicative of attempting to run additional malware or scripts without user consent.\n\n5. Persistence Mechanisms: The presence of commands that modify the Windows Registry implies an attempt at persistence, allowing the malware to survive reboots and continue executing.\n\n6. Suspicious Function Calls: Functions such as `CreateImage`, `GetImageSize`, and others related to file handling suggest that the macro is designed to interact with the filesystem in a way that is not typical for benign documents.\n\n7. Manipulation of Macro Security Settings: Although not explicitly shown in the provided code, the overall structure and behavior imply potential manipulation of security settings to allow the execution of these macros without alerting the user.\n\n8. Self-Replication and Propagation: The use of the `Auto_Open()` subroutine indicates that the macro is designed to execute automatically when the document is opened, a common feature in malware to ensure its execution without user intervention.\n\nOverall, the combination of obfuscation, registry manipulation, file operations, and suspicious function calls strongly indicates that these macros are malicious in nature, likely intended to compromise the host system or facilitate further attacks.",

It retrieves the path of the active document and constructs two file paths, `dPaw` (pointing to a DLL in the user profile directory) and `dEaw` (pointing to a PNG file in the local application data directory).  The `Document_Open` subroutine changes the document view to `wdPrintView`, checks if the system is 32-bit or 64-bit and exits if not 64-bit. It calls `process_document` which then calls `unchg`. The `unchg` subroutine performs a series of find and replace operations on the active document\u0027s content using byte arrays.  `UnBlock` is then called and modifies registry value in `HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}\\\\InProcServer32`. It attempts to create file handles for both `dPaw` and `dEaw` and checks their attributes. If these attributes meet a specific condition, it extracts embedded data from a shape within the document. This data is then written to the files specified by `dPaw` and `dEaw` using the `Unblur` function, which appears to be a custom file writing function. Following this, the attributes of both files are set to hidden. Finally, it attempts to execute `regsvr32.exe` with the path to `dPaw` (the DLL file).  The `lock_document` function contains similar registry modification and file writing actions. The `Document_Close` subroutine calls `close_document` which then calls `chg`. The `chg` subroutine also performs a series of find and replace operations on the active document\u0027s content, reversing the operations of `unchg`. The `search_image_start_end` function searches for specific byte sequences within a byte array and returns their start and end offsets.  The `get_img_bytes` function extracts a portion of the embedded data from a byte array, potentially decrypting or deobfuscating it. This function uses the byte array from a shape embedded in the document, and performs several manipulations based on offsets within that data. Finally, there are declarations for Windows API functions like `CreateProcessW`, `ReadFile`, `GetFileSize`, `WriteFile`, `CloseHandle`, `Sleep`, and `CreateFileW` (aliased to `CreateImage`, `ReadImage`, `GetImageSize`, `WriteImage`, `CloseImage`, `WaitForImage`, and `DeleteImage` respectively). `GetFileAttributesW` is also declared and aliased to `GetImageResolution`.",
