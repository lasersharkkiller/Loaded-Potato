Here are the key points of analysis:\n\n1. Obfuscation Techniques: The code employs various obfuscation techniques, such as splitting strings and using alternative text to hide functionality. For example, paths and commands are constructed by concatenating substrings, which makes it harder to read and understand at first glance.\n\n2. Registry Manipulation: The `UnBlock` subroutine contains a command that adds entries to the Windows registry. Specifically, it constructs a command to add a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID`, which is indicative of attempts to establish persistence or modify system behavior.\n\n3. File Operations: The macros include functions for reading from and writing to files, specifically targeting file paths that suggest they may be creating or modifying executable files (e.g., `C:\\ProgramData\\prnfldr.dll`). This raises concerns about potential payload delivery mechanisms.\n\n4. Execution of External Commands: The use of `CreateImage` function calls indicates that the macros can execute external processes. This is particularly concerning as it could allow the execution of arbitrary code, especially if combined with the previously mentioned file operations.\n\n5. Document Locking and Hiding Content: The macros contain functions like `lock_document` and `process_document`, which manipulate document shapes and visibility. They appear to hide certain elements within the document, potentially to conceal malicious content or actions from the user.\n\n6. Error Handling: The extensive use of `On Error Resume Next` suggests an intention to suppress errors, which is often a tactic used in malware to avoid detection and ensure continued execution despite issues.\n\n7. Self-Replication Mechanism: The presence of functions that modify the document\u0027s content (`chg` and `unchg`) implies that the macro may attempt to alter its own code or replicate itself within other documents.\n\n8. Suspicious Function Calls: The macros make calls to low-level Windows API functions, which are typically not used in benign macros. These calls can facilitate direct interaction with the operating system, allowing for more control over the environment than standard VBA would permit.\n\nOverall, the combination of obfuscation, registry manipulation, file operations, and suspicious function calls strongly indicates that these macros are designed with malicious intent, likely aimed at executing unauthorized actions on the host machine.",

The macros construct file paths within the user\u0027s profile and local application data directory. These paths are \"prnfldr.dll\" in the \"allusersprofile\" directory and \"windows.png\" in the local application data directory. The macros hide shapes within the document if the alternative text contains \"hide\". The code retrieves sizes from shapes in the documents. It attempts to read bytes from a shape, write them into the created files (\"prnfldr.dll\" and \"windows.png\"). The macro adds an entry to the registry under \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}\\InprocServer32\" pointing to \"prnfldr.dll\". It also executes \"regsvr32.exe /n /i:\u003cpath to prnfldr.dll\u003e\". This suggests that the macro is attempting to register a DLL as a COM server. Finally, the macro replaces bytes in the document with other bytes.",
